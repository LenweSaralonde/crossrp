-- This is a simple library to fetch data from community descriptions.
-- Basically, you can fetch info from any community if you have a ticket for 
--  it, so this is essentially a new way to distribute custom data to your
--  addon from an external source.
-- You create a community, enter what data you want into the group description,
--  share a permanent invite link with your addon release, and then you can 
--  request it any time, and if you update the community "description", your 
--  addon gets the updated data. Great for MOTDs, version numbers, etc.
-- The Battle.net client allows 500-character group descriptions. WoW ingame
--  only lets you input 250. I'm pretty sure the "ingame", faction-based groups
--  can also be fetched by anyone, regardless of faction. They can't join, but
--  they can still read about it.
-- One major caveat (for addons with large userbases) is that communities are
--  region-based, so you would need region detection in the addon to pick the
--  right invite code (tricky!), and multiple communities set up for each 
--  region you want to serve. Keep in mind that GetCurrentRegion just 
--  references a number hardcoded into the client, and may not reflect the
--  actual region the user is connected to. A safe way to get the region is
--  LibRealmInfo.
-- 
-- The main function to request data is:
--   LibClubMessage.Request( invite_code, callback )
--
-- The API documentation is at the bottom of the file, under PUBLIC API.

-- Request( ticket, callback )
-- 
-- Makes a request to the server for community information. The `ticket` is the
--  invite code (e.g. "owr2pVGunyM"), which should ideally be a permanent link
--  to the community that you want to read the description of/request data
--  from.
-- If called within a short period since the last request, it will just used 
--  the cached data. If you want to just READ the data and not request it again
--  use the `Read` method. When using cached data, the callback is triggered on
--  the next frame, i.e. not in the current execution path.
-- Returns true if a request is being made from the server.
--
-- Callback signature is `(description, error_code, club_info, ticket)`
--   description  Description of the club/community that the ticket is for.
--                 This will always be a string, and if the attempt to get the
--                 club info was unsuccessful, this will be an empty 
--                 string ("").
--   error_code   Error code for request. 0 is no error, otherwise it is a code
--                 from Enum.ClubErrorType.
--   club_info    The raw club info from the request. Contains things like the
--                 description, number of players in the community, community
--                 name, etc. May be `nil` for errors. Will not be `nil` if a
--                 previous request was successful (it will have the last
--                 value cached).
--   ticket       The ticket string that was used for this request.

--
-- Reads data from the cache (data is retrieved using `Request`). `ticket` is

--  made a request yet.
--
-- Returns:
-- [1] Description - The community description. Will always be a string, and an
--      empty string on error.
-- [2] Has Description - True if the description is valid and from a request;
--      false if the description hasn't been requested yet, or if there was an 
--      error.
-- [3] Club Info - The full community info from the last successful request.
--      This is of the ClubInfo type (from Blizzard's documentation). Keep in 
--      mind that some of the fields in here may not be set, as the data the
--      server provides is a subset of the full ClubInfo that you can get when
--      inside the community.
-- [4] Last Error - The error code from the last request made. 0 is no error.
--      Matches Enum.ClubErrorType
