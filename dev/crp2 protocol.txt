Cross RP 2 Protocol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doesn't use communities. Relies on Battle.net addon whispers.

Each realm has an ingame channel, `crossrp`, the broadcast channel.

When a person connects, they join the `crossrp` channel, and then tell their
 Battle.net friends who are actively playing characters on the opposite
 faction. If any of them are also connected, then they can establish a 
 cross-faction Bridge.

One client can only make a bridge with one other client.

Bridges periodically broadcast their status, which should include what
 destinations players can connect to through them. When a player wants to send
 data across factions, they choose a bridge randomly (to scatter their requests
 evenly across all bridges). The more bridges there are, the more healthy the
 cross-faction connection will be.

Not everyone needs to have a Bnet friend on the opposing faction, but the more
 there are, the healthier the connection will be, as there need to be a
 sufficient amount to handle the total traffic, especially in more crowded
 settings.

Technical hurdles to overcome:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Latency will be high, especially if you are using two middlemen:

 Player -> Ally Volunteer -> Horde Volunteer -> Broadcast Channel
 
This can be reduced if you have the cross-faction volunteer as a Bnet friend,
 omitting one middleman. However, that needs to be managed carefully, because
 the load needs to be shared across multiple bridges, not focused on one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Broadcast bandwidth is extremely limited. Ten messages per ten seconds. Large
 profiles will clog this limit easily. Maybe 5 clients per bridge allowed.
 
 Each user probably sends only a
