Cross RP 2 Protocol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doesn't use communities. Relies on Battle.net addon whispers.

Each realm has an ingame channel, `crossrp`, the broadcast channel.

When a person connects, they join the `crossrp` channel, and then tell their
 Battle.net friends who are actively playing characters on the opposite
 faction. If any of them are also connected, then they can establish a 
 cross-faction Bridge.

One client can only make a bridge with one other client.

Bridges periodically broadcast their status, which should include what
 destinations players can connect to through them. When a player wants to send
 data across factions, they choose a bridge randomly (to scatter their requests
 evenly across all bridges). The more bridges there are, the more healthy the
 cross-faction connection will be.

Not everyone needs to have a Bnet friend on the opposing faction, but the more
 there are, the healthier the connection will be, as there need to be a
 sufficient amount to handle the total traffic, especially in more crowded
 settings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical hurdles to overcome:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Latency will be high, especially if you are using two middlemen:

 Player -> Ally Volunteer -> Horde Volunteer -> Broadcast Channel
 
This can be reduced if you have the cross-faction volunteer as a Bnet friend,
 omitting one middleman. However, that needs to be managed carefully, because
 the load needs to be shared across multiple bridges, not focused on one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Broadcast bandwidth is extremely limited. Ten messages per ten seconds. Large
 profiles will clog this limit easily. Maybe 5 clients per bridge allowed.
 
 Each user probably sends only a 
 
=========================

  THE ALLIANCE PROTOCOL

=========================

Everyone joins the `crossrp` channel.
Broadcast to Battle.net friends on different BANDS than yourself that you are
 a Cross RP user.
"BAND" is unique by faction+realm. e.g. WRA-A is a different band than WRA-H.
While Cross RP is "active", bandwidth allocation is higher.
When "inactive", you still offer some of your bandwidth.
Disabled in instances. Disabled when you experience high latency (as you're a
 risky medium). Disabled in combat.
 

Transfers of profile bits directly from the source should be logged.
Transfers of profile bits through relays should not be logged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROFILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL:

If profile version is not known:
 Upon "touch" make a cross request to them and get their profile version.
 This is a private request.
 When a player changes their profile, they make a cross-broadcast request
 to give everyone their version numbers on the other sides. Otherwise it's
 a private exchange.
For each missing part, make a cross request and the opposite node asks
 for cross rp data.
 
-----------------------------------------------

[BROADCAST] status message:
ST <band+load> ...
ST -

e.g. ST 1H1 2H25 2A77

<bands>: space separated list of bands they can reach
if the mesasge is "ST -" then this means they are shutting down.
format for each band is <band><load>, load is an average of all loads for
their links.

[BNET] probe message:
HI

used to test if people are crossrp users
this is a "connect" message to make a link

[BNET] disconnect message:
BYE

severs a link with a bnet friend

[BNET] link/status message:
HO <load>

replied to HI and given periodically to active links.
load: number of links they have, used for load balancing

[WHISPER] stage 1 relay
R1 <destination> <message>

first step of message relaying, the receiver needs to pass this message
(as "R2") to a suitable band target. <destination> is where the message should
end up. <message> is the payload and may contain sub protocols.

R1 may be skipped if user owns a link themselves, as they can pick themselves
as the R1 target.

[BNET] stage 2 relay
R2 <source> <destination> <message>

second step of message relaying, crossing the faction/realm divide. bnet messages
can be longer than 255 bytes so you dont need to worry about length.

[WHISPER] stage 3 relay
R3 <source> <message>

[BROADCAST] stage 3 relay (broadcast)
R3 <source> <message>
 
==================

LINKING RAIDS

==================
 
raid leader shares message regarding destinations of linked raids

###############################################################################

events:
BAND added (when touching someone on a different destination)
BAND removed (from lack of touch)

LINKED (when linked with a 
UNLINKED (when your link logs off or 

"touching":
this occurs when a person from a different band is touched by mouseover,
 targeted, or you hear them emote
