EMOTE SPLITTER - USE DIFFERENT QUEUES FOR DIFFERENT CHAT TYPES SO THINGS ARE SENT ASYNC
REWORK PROTOCOL TO USE ASYNC MESSAGES
	BUFFER FOREIGN MESSAGES
	DISCARD IF YOU GET A TRANSLATION
	IF THERE ARE TRANSLATIONS IN THE QUEUE, DISCARD THE FOREIGN MESSAGE
	 AND EMPTY THE TRANSLATIONS QUEUE
	HAVE A WINDOW OF ABOUT 5 SECONDS FOR LATENCY
SEPARATE CONNECTION AND RELAY, RELAY IS RELAYING YOUR MESSAGES, CONNECTION IS JUST LISTENING
	CONNECTION SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC.
	PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO MISS RAID MESSAGES, AND YOU DON'T NEED THE RELAY ACTIVE
	 TO LISTEN
