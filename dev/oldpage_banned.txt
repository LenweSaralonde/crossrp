<p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> Worst case, is that Blizzard will protect the internals that Cross RP uses which will render it useless.</p>
<p><strong>Using Cross RP is not against the "Terms of Use".</strong> The World of Warcraft Terms of Use did state that you may not <em>"Communicate directly with players who are playing characters aligned with the opposite faction"</em>, and there was one "similar" addon made in 2008 which was prohibited by Blizzard (I say "similar" but it did not work with the same regulations at all). However, that was 10 years ago, before they implemented the Battle.net platform, and the Terms of Use was last updated <u>August 22, 2012</u>. The Terms of Use has since been superseded by Blizzard's newly published EULA (last updated <u>June 2018</u>), which you can find <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/eula">here (for NA people)</a>.</p>
<p>The old Terms of Use has been removed and is no longer available to read,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8vxvbg/thanks_a_lot_blizzard_for_banning_my_account_for/e1r8vw3/"> and a Blizzard CS Rep has confirmed that the new EULA has replaced it.</a></p>
<p>The Blizzard EULA doesn't have a rule against cross-faction chat.*** Chatting cross-faction might still might fall under "disruption" or "griefing" in License Limitations (for example, ruining someone's "game experience" when they see a player cooperating with the enemy), but you should be fine so long as you're just using it to RP with people who want to RP with you. Cross RP isn't using any questionable exploits to get around the barrier &ndash; it's just talking through the Battle.net chat for you, which you can already do.</p>
<p>And, for extra adherence to any <u>unspoken</u> rules, it disables itself in arenas, battlegrounds, and on non-RP realms. <em>The faction divide is a core game mechanic that should be respected where it should be respected.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>***</strong> In the <strong>European</strong> legal documentation, the <a href="http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/legal/wow_termination.html">Termination of Service</a> agreement still states that cross-faction chat is a "serious violation." I would say (with no authority) that this document is simply dated, but if you're playing on European realms, use at your own risk. I encourage anyone on the European side of things to try and get in contact with a [knowledgeable] Blizzard representative there to see if that rule is purposely left there or not (considering that using any Battle.net community ingame to chat x-faction would be a "serious violation").</p>
