--  SendPacket a bunch of times with small data (sent together within this
--  window), they'll all be compacted into a single message and sent at once

--  the client chokes on it if it sees it anywhere, so we cut this down to a
--  more manageable size. This can change if we stop using VISIBLE TEXT to
--  transfer data in the future. The soft limit is how much data we want to at
--                                 least fit in a message before sending it.
-- We can push over the soft limit if a packet happens to do so, but we don't

-- Packets are composed of these pieces: COMMAND, ARGS, and DATA.
-- At the bare minimum, if there's no data or args, then the packet can simply
--  be the COMMAND by itself, and when paired with the username in the actual
--  outputted message, it looks like this:
--
--         hh2A Tammya-MoonGuard HENLO
--
-- This is a complete packet, and more packets can follow after if there is
--  a separator.
--
--         hh2A Tammya-MoonGuard HENLO;Packet2;Packet3
--
-- That's not quite a semicolon there either. The "message" is the complete
--  message received from someone, and the "header" is the hash, protocol
--  version, faction tag, and username. Packets are commands that follow.
--
--          Message
--         vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
--         hh2A Tammya-MoonGuard RP Testing!  
--         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^
--              Header            Packet
--
-- Simple arguments can be fed to a command by the colon separator.
--
--         hh2A Tammya-MoonGuard COMMAND:arg1:arg2:arg3
--         hh2A Tammya-MoonGuard COMMAND:arg1:arg2:arg3 <data...>
-- 
-- Second is the full size packet. Extra arguments cannot contain spaces
--  or the colon character.
-- All of the packet strings must be plain, UTF-8 compliant text, or the
--                                              server may reject them.
-- In 1.1.1 the username may be replaced with "*", meaning that you should
--  use the last username seen. If you don't have that, then you just ignore
--  the message until they tell you who they are. The HENLO command causes
--                      people to send their names again on the next message.
-- In 1.1.1 the `hh` field is a base64 hash purely for making it difficult
--  for a human to input data directly into the chat window without actually
--                                                         calling our code.
