-- Cross RP
-- by Tammya-MoonGuard (2018)
--
-- All Rights Reserved
--
-- Turns a Battle.net community into a relay channel for friends to communicate
--  cross-faction for some super fun RP time!
--
-- Project concerns and goals:
--  * Easy setup - anyone should easily understand what they need to do to
--     setup a relay for their RP event.
--  * Privacy - emphasis on care for privacy on some features, as some people
--     might not understand how the relay and message logging works.
--  * Seamless translations when talking to players of opposing faction.
--     Everything should be invisible and chat bubbles are updated too. In
--     other words, once you're connected, everything should seem natural.
--  * RP profiles - one of the biggest divides between cross-faction RP, 
--     solved! This should bridge cross-realm too.
--  * Efficient protocol - we don't want to be using too much data on the 
--     logged community servers.
--  * Respect for the faction divide. We don't want this to be an "exploit".
--     We're merely using the features that are offered to us, i.e. the 
--     Battle.net community chat.

--  in a future patch we'll have more information other than a vague
--  (ambiguous, even) BattleTag name. In the end, you can just kick people
--  who misbehave from your community, but this little thing helps identify

--  a few problems, since there are multiple game accounts that could receive
