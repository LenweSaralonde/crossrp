Fine tuned some protocol things. Minor update.

**This update is not backward compatible. Tell people they need to update please. :) Sorry for the inconvenience. Please report any bugs and they will be fixed quickly!**

Reworked protocol with various optimizations to help out the servers in high traffic.

Added some things to help with frame taint. This helps with DISMISSING YOUR PET. (You will get some errors at startup, but those are unavoidable for now.)

Adjusted traffic meter (uses a longer scanning period).

Updated some compatibility.

Fixed transferring some old TRP profiles (including Chat Failed messages with these).

French translations by SolanyaStormbreaker!


## 1.1.0
Lots of changes and fixes.

Cross RP will now re-connect automatically if you reload or relog, and the relay is treated as a separate status. This is so that you can be "connected" and listen to it, but you won't actively send anything to it unless you turn on the relay. This is to help with privacy and server bandwidth saving.

Added a traffic monitor when you mouseover the minimap button.

Added a feature to show blips on the world map where people on the community are.

Cleaned everything up.

Fixed some protocol issues.

More stuff on the way.


## 1.0.0.1
Fixed botched locales.


## 1.0.0
Get ready for the battle for Azeroth!
